# A Portrait In Motion

Her sable hair, an amber diadem, 
Framing her, with mystery and beauty. 
Her poised frame, held her feminine art,
A masterpiece, sculpted by time and destiny.

Her eyes, twin pools of starlit night,
Spoke of secrets, whispered by stars.
Her voice, a melody, soft yet bright,
Turned earthly moments, into art.

Each graceful step, held a tale untold,
Her movements, cast a mystic spell. 
She carried the wisdom, of tales grown old, 
Yet danced, like dawn's first golden swell. 

The air around her, shimmered and stirred, 
As if it knew, it cradled a queen. 
Her aura, spoke louder than any word, 
A silent power, fierce, yet serene. 

Time paused, to watch her graceful ways,
As earth, and heaven, seemed to meet. 
She drew the veils, of time away,
Till time itself, forgot to stay.
