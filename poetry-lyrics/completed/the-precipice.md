# The Precipice

When you first meet your lover's eyes,
A song erupts, spirit, heart, mind,
Crying "I do" in unison,
A current you can't resist,
Drawing you, breath by breath,
To the edge where separation ends.

We say we fall in love. But do we fall?
Or does a warm, familiar wind
Remind us we were never truly apart,
Only dreaming of boundaries?
Do we move toward another,
Or simply recognize the illusion,
That the lover and beloved
Were always one beneath the veil?

Do we fall at all,
Or are we simply awakening
To what has always been true,
That you and I
Are waves of the same ocean,
Briefly taking form,
Then blending back to one?
