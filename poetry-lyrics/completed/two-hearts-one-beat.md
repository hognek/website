# Two Hearts, One Beat

Your heartbeat against my chest,
A quiet, wordless whisper.

At first, a conversation.
Yours quick and soft with life,
Mine slow and grounded,
Learning to move as one.

The space between beats
Begins to thin.

Your pulse becomes mine,
Mine becomes yours.
There never was
A difference.

I cannot tell anymore
Which heart leads,
Which follows.

Only that this rhythm
Has always been playing,
Before we lay down together,
Before we were born,
Before we were we.

One beat,
Two chests,
Two breaths,
Two names,
One whisper.

Beneath the illusion
Of separation,
One Heart beats
Through all things,

The same pulse
That moves oceans,
Turns seasons,
And draws lovers
To lie this close.

So we rest here,
Breathing each other's breath,
Two waves
Remembering
We were always
The same ocean.
