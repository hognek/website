# Where Darkness and Light Make Love

[Verse]
The moon drinks shadows from the sea
A silent hymn where stars agree
Night whispers secrets to the dove
Where darkness and light make love

[Chorus]
In the quiet
In the glow
Where the hidden truths all go
They collide
They intertwine
A dance of chaos
So divine
Where darkness and light make love

[Verse 2]
The sun bleeds gold across the mist
A fleeting touch
A burning kiss
The twilight bends
The heavens shove
To watch darkness and light make love

[Prechorus]
No borders here
No chains to hold
Just stories shared
Both new and old

[Chorus]
In the quiet
In the glow
Where the hidden truths all go
They collide
They intertwine
A dance of chaos
So divine
Where darkness and light make love

[Bridge]
The edges blur
The colors melt
A union neither's ever felt
The shadows hum
The daylight sighs
As love ignites behind closed skies
