                        Something nameless, stirs,<br>
                        Not memory, not desire,<br>
                        But recognition.</p>
                        
                        <p>Fingertips trace invisible maps,<br>
                        Each touch unveiling landscapes,<br>
                        Neither familiar, nor strange.<br>
                        As if returning to source.</p>
                        
                        <p>The candle, flickers between us,<br>
                        One flame, two shadows merging,<br>
                        Dancing along walls that seem<br>
                        Less solid than before.</p>
                        
                        <p>We name things, to know them together,<br>
                        This warmth, this current,<br>
                        This dissolving, at the edges<br>
                        As the veils of separation slowly thin.</p>
                        
                        <p>What remains, when names fade?<br>
                        When stories sleep?<br>
                        When the night holds nothing<br>
                        But this moment, endlessly opening?</p>
                        
                        <p>Our whispers blend softly,<br>
                        Knowing beyond thought,<br>
                        In a tender, shared silence,<br>
                        Love breathes, unspoken.</p>

                        <p>At first, a conversation.<br>

                        Mine slow and grounded,<br>
                        Learning to move as one.</p>

                            Turns seasons,<br>
                            And draws lovers<br>

                    <p>Through Human Design, non-dual wisdom, and the raw intelligence of the body, I help awaken a love that is both deeply human and profoundly universal.</p>
