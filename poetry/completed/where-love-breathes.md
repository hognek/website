# Where Love Breathes

Your eyes find mine, across silence.
Something nameless, stirs,
Not memory, not desire,
But recognition.

Fingertips trace invisible maps,
Each touch unveiling landscapes,
Neither familiar, nor strange.
As if returning to source.

The candle, flickers between us,
One flame, two shadows merging,
Dancing along walls that seem
Less solid than before.

We name things, to know them together,
This warmth, this current,
This dissolving, at the edges
As the veils of separation slowly thin.

What remains, when names fade?
When stories sleep?
When the night holds nothing
But this moment, endlessly opening?

Our whispers blend softly,
Knowing beyond thought,
In a tender, shared silence,
Love breathes, unspoken.
